# Project Memory: Festive Tracker

## Objective
Convert the current Santa Tracker into a versatile Holiday Countdown app that supports a "New Year Mode" with a toggle.

## Decisions & Conventions
- **App Name**: `festive-tracker` (updated from `carassai-christmas`).
- **Modes**: 
  - `christmas`: Countdown to Christmas (already implemented).
  - `new-year`: Countdown to New Year's Eve midnight.
- **Toggle**: A stylish switcher to flip between modes.

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Rename the app in `package.json`.
- [x] Initialize git repository.
- [x] Create GitHub repository using GH CLI.
- [x] Commit and push initial code.
- [x] Implement "New Year's Eve" countdown logic.
- [x] Create "New Year" visual assets/effects (e.g., Fireworks instead of Gifts?).
- [x] Add the mode toggle UI.

## Progress Tracking
- 2025-12-31: Project renamed, Git setup, New Year mode implemented with toggle and fireworks.
